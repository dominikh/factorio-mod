* Factorio physics
** Mass versus volume
   Factorio generally doesn't care about either mass or volume.
   Quantities in recipes are largely just made up to be balanced well,
   and the game never uses units of mass or volume. For example, one
   iron ore turns into one iron plate, and eight iron plates turn into
   one iron chest.

   However, volume has much less of a meaning than mass in Factorio:
   like in most games, huge items can be stored in tiny items, and
   items can be stored in themselves. We can store a large number of
   cars in the trunk of a single car.

   Mass, on the other hand, could be incorporated into the recipe
   making process, by working back from real world densities and
   areas/volumes. For example, we know that brick covers a 1x1 area of
   tiles. We also know that a tile is a square with an area of 1m²,
   and that bricks used for pavement are 6cm high in the real world.
   Given the real world density of, say, clay bricks (1922 kg/m³), we
   know that to cover a tile with clay bricks, we need 115.32 kg of
   clay bricks. If we further know that clay loses ~15% of its mass
   when firing, then we know that to make 115.32 kg of clay bricks, we
   need 135.67 kg of clay.

   By itself, this information is not very useful. Recipes are still
   dimensionless and we will turn N units of clay into M units of clay
   brick. However, if we work through the same process for another
   clay product, say clay pipes, then we can relate the two recipes,
   and figure out how much more or less units of clay it should take
   to make bricks vs pipes. The player will still not be presented
   with real world units of mass, volume or density, but making a tea
   cup won't somehow require more clay than paving a tile, and the
   exact ratios will be based on the real world.

   Many items will have relative masses established via the recipe
   graph. When burning J wood makes K wood ash, which in turn can be
   refined into M potash and used to make N gunpowder, then all of
   these masses are related. However, items may end up not being
   related at all, and one unit of stone may be incomprable to one
   unit of iron plate.

** Distance, speed of travel
   A tile is a square with an area of 1m², which allows us to relate
   sizes of entities to the real world. However, the speed of travel
   in Factorio is much higher. The character runs at a default speed
   of 32 km/h, which can further be boosted with upgrades and
   different tiles. In comparison, the average jogging speed in the
   real world is around 10 km/h. Similarly, cars in Factorio are
   unreasonably fast: their lowest speed is 87.6 km/h and their
   highest speed is 208.1 km/h.

   Therefore, when we decide on distances, e.g. how far apart to spawn
   rare ores, we should keep this difference in speeds in mind.

** Liquid amounts
   Factorio uses the real concept of heat capacity for heating up
   liquids, and for turning water into steam. Water specifically has a
   heat capacity of 200 J per Kelvin and unit of water. If we simply
   equated this to water's real heat capacity (4182 J / (K kg)), then
   one unit of water would correspond to about 50 g.

   However, this equivalence implies that a tank, which holds 25,000
   units of fluid, holds just 1250 kg of water – or 1250 liters at the
   real world density of water. This is problematic, because it would
   make the tank roughly 20cm "high".

   If we ignore heat capacity and instead use the tank's volume as
   rendered in game (a diameter of 2.8m and roughly 2m high), then
   25,000 units correspond to 49,260 liters, or almost 2 L per unit of
   water. Such large amounts per unit wouldn't be useful. A single
   unit cannot be further divided. Also, any machine producing very
   low amounts of water would not work accurately. Testing has shown
   that machines that produce <= 3 units of water per second are not
   working correctly, producing no water at all.

   In the end, we may have to tweak the capacity of tanks, possibly
   the capacity/throughput of pipes and pumps, and maybe even the heat
   capacity.

** Steam power and heat capacity
   Factorio uses the real concept of heat capacity for heating up
   liquids, and for turning water into steam. Water specifically has a
   heat capacity of 200 J per Kelvin and unit of water. Unfortunately,
   Factorio does not model the energy needed for transitioning from
   the liquid state to the gaseous state. Instead, it simply assumes
   that once the temperature reaches 100 degrees Celsius, the water
   will become steam. Thus, making steam requires a lot less energy
   than it should. It also (conceptually) releases too little energy
   when condensing.

   Another issue lies with the way steam engines operate: they can
   extract energy from steam all the way down to 15 degrees Celsius,
   when they should (at best) only work till 100 degrees Celsius. On
   the other hand, steam engines do not output the cooled down water
   or steam, which means we cannot use the waste heat for other
   purposes to increase overall efficiency. In that way, it might seem
   "fair" that the steam engine can extract all the energy.

** Accumulators and solar power
   Both accumulators and solar powers have way wrong efficiencies
   compared to the real world.

   For solar, consider the real world baseline: our solar panels are
   10-20% efficient, and can produce 300 W/m² in extremely sunny areas
   (i.e. Africa). Thus, at perfect efficiency, we would expect 3000
   W/m². Solar panels in Factorio produce 20 kW / m², an absurd
   amount. Either they are magic, or we are so close to the sun that
   we should all be dead.

   Interestingly, accumulators are vastly underpowered in comparison.
   Storing energy at 0.17 Wh/L. Meanwhile, real world densities are as
   such:

   | Kind           | Density in Wh/L |
   |----------------+-----------------|
   | Lead acid      |              90 |
   | Nickel cadmium |          50-150 |
   | Li-Ion         |         250-693 |


* Game design
** Quality of materials
   IRL, many materials come in different qualities that improved over
   time. For example, different kinds of concrete have existed over
   time, with newer ones usually being stronger and more durable.
   Another example is switching from clay bricks to concrete bricks.
   Yet another example are railway tracks, moving from cast iron to
   wrought iron and finally to steel.

   While we could theoretically model different qualities of a
   material as different items, this would pose problems.

   For construction materials like bricks, we would need many recipes
   for low tier machines: a basic kiln should be able to be built with
   clay bricks as well as all kinds of concrete bricks. Since Factorio
   recipes do not allow for "or" inputs, this would indeed require
   many separate recipes, cluttering the UI.

   For placeable items like railway tracks, we certainly don't want
   different tiers of tracks in the world, nor do we want to model
   attributes such as max weight or max speed that rails of a certain
   kind can support.

   Instead of modeling quality, we can express it in terms of
   productivity: make producing bricks from modern concrete much more
   efficient than producing bricks from clay, for example by requiring
   fewer inputs or less time. This increase has to be significant
   enough to justify the initial investment of using more complex
   recipes, while at the same time we must avoid making recipes
   over-powered.

   Note that some differentiation between qualities still needs to be
   modelled as different items, to gate progress. For example, some
   buildings will require steel beams to be built, and it shouldn't be
   able to substitute steel beams with less efficiently made wrought
   iron beams.

   Lower tier buildings, however, would be happy with wrought iron. In
   these cases we might want to offer multiple recipes for the lower
   tier buildings, so that making older buildings doesn't require
   keeping older production lines around.
** Progression
   In the base game, progression tends to require the previous stages
   as input. For example, steel is made from iron plates; and if
   something even better than steel existed, it would most likely
   contain steel as an ingredient.

   Our mod aims to stick close to reality, which means that this kind
   of progression is not always possible. For example, pig iron would
   be turned into cast iron or wrought iron (two lower tier metals),
   or into steel (a higher tier metal). Making steel would not require
   cast iron or wrought iron as an input.

   One implication of this is that old production lines may become
   unnecessary: as the player upgrades to steel, wrought iron
   production can be torn down. This fact requires special
   consideration for recipes: a tier 1 machine will nominally require
   wrought iron, while a tier 2 machine will require steel. However,
   if the user has upgraded to steel and tore down wrought iron
   production, they won't be able to build tier 1 machines anymore,
   even though steel should effectively be a drop-in replacement for
   wrought iron in old buildings. This has two obvious solutions: 1)
   have multiple recipes for tier 1 machines 2) design progression in
   a way that will make it unlikely for the user to desire lower tier
   buildings when higher tier buildings have become available. More
   concretely, once steel (and other resources) have become available,
   there should be no reason to still build lower tier machines.

* Random collection of notes, to be sorted through
** Diesel engines
   From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_generator#Fuels:

   Diesel fuel is named after diesel engines, and not vice versa;
   diesel engines are simply compression-ignition engines, and can
   operate on a variety of different fuels, depending on configuration
   and location. Where a gas grid connection is available, gas is
   often used, as the gas grid will remain pressurized during almost
   all power cuts. This is implemented by introducing gas with the
   intake air and using a small amount of diesel fuel for ignition.
   Conversion to 100% diesel fuel operation can be achieved
   instantaneously.[9]

   In more rural situations, or for low load factor plant, diesel fuel
   derived from crude oil is a common fuel; it is less likely to
   freeze than heavier oils. Endurance will be limited by tank size.
   Diesel engines can work with the full spectrum of crude oil
   distillates, from natural gas, alcohols, gasoline, wood gas to the
   fuel oils from diesel oil to cheaper residual fuels that are like
   lard at room temperature, and must be heated to enable them to flow
   down a fuel line.[10]

   Larger engines (from about 3 MWe to 30 MWe) sometimes use heavy
   oils, essentially tars, derived from the end of the refining
   process. The slight added complexity of keeping the fuel oil heated
   to enable it to flow, whilst mitigating the fire risks that come
   from over-heating fuel, make these fuels unpopular for smaller,
   often unmanned, generating stations.

   Other possible fuels include: biodiesel, straight vegetable oil,
   animal fats and tallows, glycerine, and coal-water slurry. These
   should be used with caution and due to the composistion, normally
   have a detrimental effect on engine life.
** Mining
   when mining, we get a mix of ore and rock. there will be a series
   of steps to liberate the ore, increasing the overall yield of
   ore.

   ores often appear together. for example, malachite often occurs
   together with azurite, goethite and calcite. the ratios vary, and it
   would not be viable to add entities for all possible combinations.
   maybe instead we can address this by having mixed ore patches. we'd
   also need some pure patches, that don't require filtering, for early
   game.

   to solve the issue of early-game purification, we could spawn pure
   metals in the starting area.

   ideally, crushing and filtering raw ore leaves us with fewer items
   overall. we've removed the gangue, and made the ore much more compact,
   which should make it easier to transport, i.e. need less belt
   throughput.

   basically a loop of crushing and filtering, trying to crush smaller
   and smaller to be able to extract as much as possible.

   need to balance filtering to get more metal with filtering to improve purity

   several levels of crushing.

   different metals might need different crushers; e.g. gold is too soft for some

   fractioning.

   direct shipping ore

   The separation of mineral from gangue is known as mineral processing,
   mineral dressing, or ore dressing. It is a necessary, and often
   significant, aspect of mining. It can be a complicated process,
   depending on the nature of the minerals involved.[2] For example,
   galena, an ore of lead, is usually found in large pieces within its
   gangue, so it does not normally need extensive processing to remove
   it; but cassiterite, the chief ore of tin, is usually disseminated as
   very small crystals throughout its gangue, so when it is mined from
   hard rock, the ore-bearing rock first needs to be crushed very
   finely,[3] and then has to be subjected to sophisticated processes to
   separate the ore.


   "Relating to the different subsets of ore types, I would say this: 6
   would be the definite limit, I'd say.. In the copper example, it's
   clear enough: Tenorite requires less carbon than Cuprite, Malochite
   and Chalcocite need pre-processing, Chalcopyrite and Bornite need 2
   steps pre-processing plus an additional input"
** Copper
   There are many ores, but they largely boil down to copper sulfides,
   copper oxides and native copper. There's no point in being more
   fine-grained than that.
*** Processing
	Leaching oxides, pyrometallurgy for sulfides. Can leach sulfides
	but requires bacteria.

	"One of the biggest advantages of using leaching is that low grade
	ores that would be uneconomic to smelt become economic to leach. This
	is largely due to the much lower energy costs of leaching and also to
	the lower capital and employment costs of the process."

	"As of 2005, roasting is no longer common in copper concentrate
	treatment, because its combination with reverberatory furnaces is not
	energy efficient and the SO2 concentration in the roaster offgas is
	too dilute for cost-effective capture.[8] Direct smelting is now
	favored, e.g. using the following smelting technologies: flash
	smelting, Isasmelt, Noranda, Mitsubishi or El Teniente furnaces.[8] "

	"Gill quotes a copper in slag value of 0.23% for a wet-charged
	reverberatory furnace vs 0.37% for a calcine-charged furnace"

	"The vertical edges of the stainless steel plates are covered with
	tight-fitting polymer edge strips to prevent copper depositing around
	the edge of the cathode plate and so make it easier to strip the
	cathode copper from them"

	"The bottom of the cathode plates were masked with a thin film of wax,
	again to prevent the copper depositing around the bottom edge"

	"Commonly sulfuric acid is used as a leachant for copper oxide,
	although it is possible to use water, particularly for ores rich in
	ultra-soluble sulfate minerals"
*** Roasting
	Roasting CuFeS₂ (Chalcopyrite) has (primarily) these two reactions:
	2CuFeS₂ + 4O₂ → 2FeO + Cu₂S + 3SO₂
	2Cu₂S + 3O₂ → 2Cu₂O + 2SO₂

	When we later smelt the calcine into matte, the following reaction occurs:
	Cu₂O + FeS → Cu₂S + FeO
	which means we'll convert the copper oxide we made back to copper sulfide.

	Converting the matte into blister copper, finally, reduces the copper:
	Cu₂S + O₂ → 2Cu + SO₂

	Therefore, when roasting and smelting, we only need to roast partially.

	This also suggests that if we roast fully, all the copper sulfide
	will become copper oxide, which we'd be able to leach with
	sulfuric acid.

** Random notes
   Isalmelt:
	 - ~60% Cu in matte
	 - 0.75% Cu in slag
	 - 25% SO2 in offgas

   - the further from spawn, the less rich ores get
   - tank leaching vs heap leaching
   - look into the roughing, cleaning and scavenging steps of froth
	 flotation, and see if we want to model those.
   - IsaMill might be a tech upgrade that makes milling cheaper or produce more output (to reflect the fact that IsaMill output works better with froth flotation)

** Other notes
   Coal gasification's main benefit seems to be that burning the
   resulting gas is cleaner than burning coal directly, and that
   making the gas is easier/cheaper than burning coal and trying to
   capture all the pollutants. But do Factorio players even care about
   pollution? We need some other incentive for using gas instead…
   Maybe simply by providing more efficient machines and means of
   energy production that depend on gas? But how can we do that and
   not violate the laws of thermodynamics? A boiler full of coal
   heating up steam is pretty darn efficient… We can say that dirtier
   fuels produce energy less efficiently because they fill up machines
   with soot and ash and whatnot?

   "When coal is used for electricity generation, it is usually
   pulverized and then burned in a furnace with a boiler.[72] The
   furnace heat converts boiler water to steam, which is then used to
   spin turbines which turn generators and create electricity.[73] The
   thermodynamic efficiency of this process varies between about 25%
   and 50% depending on the pre-combustion treatment, turbine
   technology (e.g. supercritical steam generator) and the age of the
   plant"

   https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/coal-gasification

   Also, we need to separate electricity generation from other uses of
   energy. A normal furnace that burns stuff doesn't have an
   efficiency factor. It just takes the MJ of the coal and magically
   turns it into energy.
